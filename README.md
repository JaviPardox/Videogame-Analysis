This scrip runs through purchase_data.csv which holds the data of the players name, age, and gender. It also holds the data of items and their price. 
The goal is to find meaningful data from the count of the total number of players, gender demographics, purchasing analysis, age demographics, top spenders, most popular items, and most profitable items.

### Conclusion 
The majority of players are males, that includes the majority of the purchases as well. 
+75% of the players are aged 15 to 29, with most of the players aged 20 to 24, they're as well the group that spends the most in the game.
Independently of the age, players spend an average of $3 and $4.  The lists of the top 5 most popular items and most profitable items are very similar meaning that players are finding what the most profitable items are.
